**AWS Primer: Cloud 101 for Newbies**

## Introduction to AWS and Cloud Computing
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud service provider offering a wide range of cloud computing services. Cloud computing allows users to access computing resources like servers, storage, and databases over the internet, providing scalability, cost savings, and flexibility.

## Basic Cloud Computing Concepts
| **Concept**          | **Description** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Cloud Computing**  | On-demand delivery of computing services over the internet. |
| **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** | Provides virtualized computing resources. Example: EC2. |
| **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** | Provides a managed platform for application development. Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk. |
| **SaaS (Software as a Service)** | Software applications hosted in the cloud. Example: AWS WorkSpaces. |
| **Regions and Availability Zones (AZs)** | AWS has multiple data centers worldwide, divided into Regions and AZs for high availability. |
| **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** | A logically isolated network for AWS resources, customizable with subnets. |
| **Subnets** | A segment of a VPC that divides resources into private and public zones. |
| **Scalability** | Ability to increase/decrease resources based on demand. |
| **Elasticity** | Automatically adjusts resources to match workload changes. |
| **Pay-as-you-go** | Pay only for what you use without upfront costs. |

## AWS Free Tier
AWS offers a **Free Tier** that allows users to explore cloud services with limited usage for **12 months**. Key benefits:
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: 750 hours/month of t2.micro instance.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: 30GB of free storage.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: 750 hours/month of db.t2.micro.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: 5GB free storage.
- **Lambda**: 1 million free requests/month.

## Introduction to AWS Services
AWS provides a vast ecosystem of services. Here are some fundamental ones:

### Compute Services
| **Service** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** | Virtual machines in the cloud with customizable configurations. |
| **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** | Fully managed container orchestration service for Docker containers. |
| **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** | Managed Kubernetes service for deploying containerized applications. |

### Storage Services
| **Service** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** | Object storage service with high scalability and security. |
| **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** | Block storage for EC2 instances. |
| **Glacier** | Low-cost archival storage. |

### Networking Services
| **Service** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** | Isolated cloud network for AWS resources, allowing custom configurations of subnets, security groups, and routing tables. |
| **Subnets** | Logical subdivisions of a VPC, categorized as public or private. |
| **Route 53** | Scalable DNS web service. |
| **CloudFront** | Content delivery network (CDN) for fast content delivery. |
| **Internet Gateway** | Allows public internet access for resources in a VPC. |
| **NAT Gateway** | Enables private instances to access the internet securely. |

### Security and Identity
| **Service** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** | Manages user permissions and roles. |
| **AWS Shield** | Protects against DDoS attacks. |
| **AWS WAF** | Web Application Firewall for security. |

### Database Services
| **Service** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
